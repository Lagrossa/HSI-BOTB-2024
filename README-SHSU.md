Scholar Threads App
Overview: 

The app allows users to donate clothes in exchange for a discount by taking a picture of the material tag of the item. Users will receive a ticket for the exchange of the donation and a barcode to show when dropping off the donation at the nearest location or their college. Users can also buy clothes made from recycled material through donations for a low price.  Additionally, users can connect to their college community to compete on which college can donate the most.

Frameworks:


Data Collection:
When the user takes a picture of the material tag, the information will be automatically filled by text recognition and run on a supervised machine learning model to determine the material made based on the tag. Based on the information provided, the app creates a barcode for drop-off and imports data received to the database for further analysis to decrease textile waste in the region and globally.
